* Overall
- [ ] Add VST support
  - [ ] Weird, I'm getting undefined symbol: _ZN8dsynkant14D50CharToASCIIEh
- [ ] Use a real logging system like the one provided by boost

* Set
- [ ] Address is buggy (memory leaks in operator-)
- [ ] Address can be simplified using boost operators

* Engine
- [ ] Complete Voice with rendering method (takes an audio buffer and
  adds the rendered signal to it)
- [ ] Starts with dummy generator, just to see if it works so far
