DSynkant
========

Descripion
----------

DSynkant is a virtual synthesizer that emulate the Roland D50/D550. So
far it supports DSSI but is being developed in a way that would be
easily to other softsynth API like VST.

It is largely incomplete, if you want to help you are more than
welcome. In particular, I don't own a Roland D-50, so if you own one,
I can definitely find ways to help.

Requirement
-----------

- DSSI

Compilation
-----------

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

should work. If not maybe you have to install DSSI first.

Bugs
----

Unknown. Please create an issue if you find some.
