DSynkant
========

Descripion
----------

DSynkant is a virtual synthesizer that emulate the Roland D50/D550. So
far it supports DSSI but is being developed in such a way that would
be easy to suport other softsynth API like VST.

It is largely incomplete, if you want to help you are more than
welcome, in fact it might just be enough to motivate me to resume work
on it.

Requirement
-----------

- DSSI

Compilation
-----------

Something like :

./configure
make
su -c "make install"

should work. If not maybe you have to install DSSI first, otherwise 
see the file INSTALL

Bugs
----

Unknown. Please create an issue if you find some.
