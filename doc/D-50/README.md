Copy of D-50 manuals
====================

Here's a copy of the D-50 manuals I found on
```
http://www.rolandus.com/support/owners_manuals/
```
for convenience.

I couldn't find any copyright mention on the manuals so I assume there
are legally copied here. If not let me know.

The manual VC-1_XT_OM.pdf from the same place is also an awesome
source of information. I don't include it between it has the copyright
mention (maybe this whole copyright thing is stupid).
